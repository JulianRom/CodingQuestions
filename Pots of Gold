Two players X and Y are playing a game in which there are pots of gold arranged in a line, each containing some gold coins.
They get alternating turns in which the player can pick a pot from one of the ends of the line.
The winner is the player who has a higher number of coins at the end.
The objective is to maximize the number of coins collected by X, assuming Y also plays optimally.
Return the maximum coins X could get while playing the game. Initially, X starts the game.

class Solution {
public:
    int maxCoins(vector<int>&A,int n)
    {
	    vector<int> opt(A);
	    vector<int> sum(A);
	    for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
	        for (int j = 0; j < n - i; j++) {
	            opt[j] = std::max(
	                A[j] + sum[j + 1] - opt[j],
	                A[j + i] + sum[j] - opt[j + 1]);
	            sum[j] += A[j + i];
	        }
	    }
	    return opt[0];
    }
};
